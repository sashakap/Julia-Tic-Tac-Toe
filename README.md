# Learning Julia by making a Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Version 1.0

## Project Summary
This project was done to learn about the Julia programming language sytax
Throughout the project I learned good practices of the Julia Langauge, and general structure of a scripting language. Additionally I practiced working with git, and familiarized myself with Markdown.<br>

## Project Features
By running this file in the Julia Repl and invoking the `game()` function, you get to play the computer in a game of tic-tac-toe. You can choose to go either first or second, and play the computer until the game is over. After the game finishes, you will see a .txt file called `"results.txt"` containing a record of your most previous game.

## Extensibility
Future implementations of the project will contain:
- A minimax algorithm to create a more competitive AI
- A graph or visual aid representing the algorithm
