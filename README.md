# Learning Julia by making a Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Version 1.1

## Project Summary
This project was done to learn about the Julia programming language sytax, and working with the PlotlyJS.JL library. Throughout the project I learned good practices of the Julia Langauge, general scripting language structure, and working with APIs. Additionally I practiced working with git, and familiarized myself with Markdown.<br>

## Project Features
By running the including the Dispatch.jl file in the Julia Repl, you get to play the computer in a game of tic-tac-toe. You go first, and  click on any light blue(empty) space where you want to place an "X" on the board. After another click anywhere on the board, the computer places an "O" on the board. This process iterates until the game is over, and once the game finishes, you will see a .png file called `"Results.png"` containing a record of your most previous game.

## Extensibility
Future implementations of the project will contain:
- A minimax algorithm to create a more competitive AI
